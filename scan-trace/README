				Scan Trace
				----------

(Implemented by Uday Khedker (uday@cse.iitb.ac.in) for course cs302-2020-21 at
IIT Bombay).

This directory contains a program that prints the trace of scanning by 
printing out step no, current state, buffer, last final state, character at
the marked position, and next character.

Use the command 

    $ ./show-lex-trace.sh file.l < input_file

Alternatively, give the command

    $ ./show-lex-trace.sh file.l 

and type input from the keyboard.

The trace output is indented by one TAB to distinguish it from the default out 
the lex script. Besides, new lines are replaced by spaces for convenience of
viewing of the trace.

The program consists of a driver shell script (show-lex-trace.sh) that executes
lex on th given lex script, then calls a couple of awk scripts (lex-trace.awk 
and process-lex-dfa.awk), uses a c code template, to generate a binary which is
then executed to perform scanning and produce the trace of scanning.

All these scripts and templates have to be in the same directory for the program
to work properly (or the shell script will have to be modified to provide path 
information).
